# Testing Screen Resolution

This Chocolatey package uses [serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) and
[selenium-webdriver](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Ruby-Bindings)
for acceptance tests. [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) is
required for acceptance testing and it is installed for you during
provisioning.  Maven tests are also available, but Maven is not
installed during provisioning.

Contributions to this Chocolatey package will only be accepted if all
Ruby tests pass successfully.

## Set Up

Install the latest version of
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Clone the latest version from the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:dhoer/choco-screen-resolution.git
    cd choco-screen-resolution

If vagrant was updated and throws errors, the vagrant plugins might
need to be reinstalled:

    vagrant plugin expunge --reinstall

## Running

Startup Vagrant Windows 2016 Server, provision it (provision will
occur automatically on first run), and then reload to
start the Selenium Grid service:

    vagrant up
    vagrant reload

If provisioning and reload went ok, then Selenium Grid should be
visible from here: http://localhost:4444/grid/console.

## Development

By default, Vagrant shares your project directory (that is the one with
the Vagrantfile) with the `C:/vagrant` directory in your guest machine.

Note that `C:/Users/vagrant` is a different directory than the synced
`C:/vagrant` directory.

If you make changes in the project directory, you will need to
provision again and reload in order to see those changes:

    vagrant provision
    vagrant reload

## Acceptance Testing

From the guest Windows box, open a PowerShell window and run Ruby
serverspec and selenium-webdriver tests via `rake`:

    cd C:\vagrant
    rake

Maven users can execute browser tests from host machine:

    mvn clean test

## Integration Testing

Maven users can override the selenium url and screen height and width
via environment variables:

    export SELENIUM_URL=http://example.com:4444/wd/hub
    export SCREEN_WIDTH=1280
    export SCREEN_HEIGHT=1024
    mvn clean test
